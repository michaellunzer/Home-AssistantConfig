# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my Home Assistant installation running on a Lenovo M93P "Tiny" server. They are typically around $120 on eBay and are very low powered. 
With Proxmox as a hypervisor, you can also run other Virtual Machines to do other things, like be a NAS or a web server. 

## Some statistics about my installation:
